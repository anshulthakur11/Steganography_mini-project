 Introduction
This Python script allows you to hide a secret text message within an image using steganography. Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video. In this case, the text message is hidden within the pixels of the image, making it imperceptible to the human eye.

**Requirements**
To run this script, you need to have the following installed on your system:

Python
Tkinter (Python's standard GUI library)
Pillow (Python Imaging Library, required for image processing)
Stegano (Python library for steganography)
You can install the necessary dependencies using pip:

**Copy code**

 pip install pillow
 
 pip install stegano
 
 
 **Usage**

Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script.
Run the script by executing the following command:
Copy code
python steganography.py
The graphical user interface (GUI) will appear.
Click on the "Open Image" button to select an image file (in JPG format) to hide the text message.
Type your secret message in the text box provided.
Click on the "Hide Data" button to embed the text message into the selected image.
To reveal the hidden message from an image, click on the "Show Data" button.
You can save the modified image with the hidden message by clicking on the "Save Image" button.  


**Notes**

Make sure to select a JPEG image file to hide the text message. Other file formats are not supported.
The hidden message can only be revealed from an image that has been processed by this script.
Be cautious when hiding sensitive information, as steganography may not provide complete security against sophisticated attackers.
